# MSP430_SCA
This repo contains (hopefully) helpful resources to perform a side channel attack on an MSP430. This was created because an oscilloscope was used to collect power traces. The power traces were stored as .mat files and we were struggling to find SCA algorithms that took .mat files as input. 

## Where to start
The MSP430 SCA.ipynb file is well commented and contains everything that is provided by this repo so far.

## Data
I could not upload our power trace data because it exceeded the file size limit.
